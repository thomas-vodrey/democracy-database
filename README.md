# Democracy in Database

Democracy in Database represents the functions of a local board of elections in the fictional Zenith County, Winnemac.

This repo contains all necessary code and infrastructure needed to run the back-end containers of the project. The front-end UI is available elsewhere on Appsmith.

## Features

### Voters

Voters can register for the first time or, if already registered, change their address or party registration. Once registered they can view their sample ballot to see upcoming elections and the candidates they'll be voting on.

### Candidates

Candidates can view information on the offices up for election and whether they've qualified for the ballot. Candidates can also access a voter lookup for the sake of canvassing.

### Election Officials

Election officials oversee the election processes by updating the number of signatures candidates have received to appear on the ballot, and processing absentee ballot requests made by voters.
